               Started by working on the monolithic Ruby on Rails platform, then shifted focus to designing and building micro-services using AWS.
                <br>
                  Work activities ranged from day-to-day technical tasks on the existing systems, to researching how to build, deploy or test new services or configuring CI flows to assisting other teams (such as qa-automation).
                <br>
                I've learned a lot on this project, from growing my AWS skills (and interest for devops) to the complexities of working fully remote in a global company.

                Worked on the main platform which is built in Ruby on Rails with memcached, redis, mongodb and postgres. Also worked on additional services written in Padrino and Sinatra.
                <br>
                  My responsibilities included designing and implementing solutions, collaborating with other teams both remote and on-site.
                <br>
                Working in an agile environment with a high emphasis on automatic testing and thorough code reviews, I also contributed to developing and maintaining the server infrastructure with Docker.

                Worked on multiple RESTful platforms, tools and middleware written in Ruby with Ruby on Rails, elasticsearch, eventmachine, memcached, Redis, et al.
                <br>
                Outside of implementing web platforms in Ruby on Rails in a SCRUM development environment, I took responsibility in implementing responsive user interfaces using JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Backbone.js and moustache.
                <br>
                Application deployment has been done both in platform as well as dedicated environments like Heroku and dedicated servers which we set up using Capistrano, nginx, Phusion Passenger.

            In my spare time, I'd been building a wine crowd-sourcing start-up alongside 2 passionate bussiness partners.
            <br>
            I designed the whole system architecture, from the database structure to the REST apis and the deployment process. It's based on the latest stable Ruby on Rails with Postgres. <br>
            Besides building the website, I also worked closely with an Swift developer in designing the specifications and supporting the implementation of the iOS app (soon to appear on the App Store).
